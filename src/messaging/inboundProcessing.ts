/**
 * One inbound text → one turn of the conversation (src/messaging/agent.ts)
 * → one reply in the household's group thread.
 *
 * This used to be a router: a "fix <merchant>" regex, then a batch
 * resolver that paired the reply against open items, then a separate Q&A
 * call for whatever was left over, each with its own failure text. All of
 * that is now the agent's job, including deciding that a message is a
 * question rather than a categorization — the only thing left here is the
 * rule that survived every rewrite: a text that arrives always gets an
 * answer back (PLAN.md §5.3). Silence reads as "my message vanished",
 * which is worse than any error we could send.
 *
 * `userId` is who sent the text; it rides along to the agent purely for
 * attribution on anything the turn writes.
